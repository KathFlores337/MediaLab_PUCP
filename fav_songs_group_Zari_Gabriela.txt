Misguided Ghosts - Gabriela Zari
[Intro]
One, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
I am going away for a while
But I'll be back, don't try and follow me
'Cause I'll return as soon as possible
See, I'm trying to find my place
But it might not be here where I feel safe
We all learn to make mistakes

[Pre-Chorus]
And run from them, from them
With no direction
We'll run from them, from them
With no conviction

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm just one of those ghosts
Traveling endlessly
Don't need no roads
In fact, they follow me
And we just go in circles

[Verse 2]
Now I'm told that this is life
And pain is just a simple compromise
So we can get what we want out of it
Would someone care to classify
Our broken hearts and twisted minds?
So I can find someone to rely on
