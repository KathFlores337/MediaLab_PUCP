Don't Panic 
Bones, sinking like stones
All that we fought for
Homes, places we've grown
All of us are done for
And we live in a beautiful world
Yeah, we do, yeah, we do
We live in a beautiful world
Bones, sinking like stones
All that we fought for
And homes, places we've grown
All of us are done for (done for)
And we live in a beautiful world
Yeah, we do, yeah, we do
We live in a beautiful world
And we live in a beautiful world
Yeah, we do, yeah, we do
We live in a beautiful world
Oh, all that I know
There's nothing here to run from
'Cause yeah, everybody here's
Got somebody to lean on

BEAUTIFUL DAY (Miri)
The heart is a bloom
Shoots up through the stony ground
There's no room
No space to rent in this town
You're out of luck
And the reason that you had to care
The traffic is stuck
And you're not moving anywhere
You thought you'd found a friend
To take you out of this place
Someone you could lend a hand
In return for grace
It's a beautiful day
Sky falls, you feel like
It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
You're on the road
But you've got no destination
You're in the mud
In the maze of her imagination
You love this town
Even if that doesn't ring true
You've been all over
And it's been all over you
It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
It's a beautiful day (Oooh, ooh)
Touch me
Take me to that other place
Teach me love
I know I'm not a hopeless case
See the world in green and blue
See China right in front of you
See the canyons broken by cloud
See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out
See the Bedouin fires at night
See the oil fields at first light
And see the bird with a leaf in her mouth
After the flood all the colors came out
Day, Day
Day, Day

Believe (Alice)
After love, after love
After love, after love
After love, after love
After love, after love
After love, after love
After love, after love
No matter how hard I try
You keep pushing me aside
And I can't break through
There's no talking to you
It's so sad that you're leaving
It takes time to believe it
But after all is said and done
You're gonna be the lonely one, oh
Do you believe in life after love?
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no
Do you believe in life after love?
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no
What am I supposed to do?
Sit around and wait for you?
Well, I can't do that
And there's no turning back
I need time to move on
I need a love to feel strong
'Cause I've had time to think it through
And maybe I'm too good for you, oh
Do you believe in life after love?
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no
Do you believe in life after love?
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no
Well, I know that I'll get through this
'Cause I know that I am strong
And I don't need you anymore
I don't need you anymore
Oh, I don't need you anymore
No, I don't need you anymore
Do you believe in life after love?
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no
Do you believe in life after love?
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no
Do you believe in life after love?
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no
Do you believe in life after love?
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no
